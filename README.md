# Knucklebones Dice Game

If you've played the game Cult of the Lamb, you may remember the optional dice minigame. I thought it was really fun, so I decided to recreate it. While this is a 1:1 recreation of the rules, it's not a 1:1 recreation of the aesthetics.

Credits goes to the the studio behind Cult of the Lamb, Massive Monster, for the game rules.
